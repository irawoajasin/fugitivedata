in so many words, i am problematizing the daily technological rituals we use for memory keeping and personal archiving. growing up, we flipped through photo albums containing images passed from hand to hand, across border and oceans. by peering at these collections of images, noting their arrangments, we are introduced to a relationship with our heritige and history rooted in relationality, storytelling, and love.

what are the implications of using big tech platforms to digitally archive our lives? how do the logics of the platform impact the way that we remember? how do said technologies remember? how can we build remembering technologies that do not remember in order to sell you things or build an algorithmic understanding of who we are, but instead encourage us to remember?

We're living in an age of digital information. We're bombarded by stuff all the time. And so much of what we've seen of these protests is being documented in real time on social media. Why isn't that enough? Why isn't that its own archive?  
  
An archive is actually a space where, in theory, we are processing information; we're arranging and describing it according to a certain set of standards. And we're making it discoverable in specific types of ways and we're stewarding it for what we often think is a very long future.” [source](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/beirut-explosion-covid-19-rehab-centres-black-is-king-blackivists-lindy-west-and-more-1.5676297/this-team-of-black-archivists-is-dedicated-to-documenting-the-black-lives-matter-movement-1.5676910)  

Websites (particularly social media sites) are sorry excuses for archives. They lack in the foundational and critical affordances that archives are meant to address. The question I am posing is how to make a website (and related infrastructure) that is a proper critical archive? Or at least question the use of websites as archives through provocation.

this week i developed [my process website](https://irawoajasin.github.io/fugitive-digital-archives/index.html). this is written by hand and hosted using github pages. up top you can find links to my research resources, a project timeline, and a way to contact me.  
  
outside of this website, this week i experimented with a collection of [computational poetry](https://irawoajasin.github.io/datafiedpasts_desirousfutures/) that grows and speaks to each other. in my final piece, want it to allow visitors to have data presented to them as questions rather than definitive statements. i want to explore what a poetic of data might feel like that takes algorithmic predictions and questions/ritualizes/probes at them. i tried my hand at setting up my raspberry pi to put this small dataset of poetry grammars on but i had some trouble. i aim to have that piece completed by next week
