This week I am doing some thinking about what metaphors may be useful to explore the four dimensions of fugitive memory technologies:
1. fluid over legible
2. culturally embedded & situated in place
3. embodied & dialogic
4. intimate and relational

Based on these guiding considerations, I tried to come up with some ideas.

# data composting
 > Culturally embedded dialog physically around archives supports the sustainability of digital archives by allowing its language and metadata to live, grow, die, and morph based on who the language is in service of at that time.
 
One thought I was how can a digital archive feel more like composting as opposed to a garbage dump. The action of "dumping" is very commonly used in online archiving (think: photo dumps) which contributes to the concept of infinitely growing feeds/piles of *stuff* that we never really return back to. 

By treating a digital archive as a compost bin rather than a dumping ground, we emphasize culturally embedded sustainability in the practice of stewardship. Through more choice additions, consistent rotating/tilling/pruning, and regular use/review of the material in service of growth, we may take more of a compost approach. Not abandoning material into the fast current of the feed but tucking it away to slowly ripen over time.

### the dataset
In this thinking, a dataset in question may look like something that is added to by multiple people, with each individual taking something they maybe no longer need or have much use for, and contributing to a collective library. It should be **participatory and changing**

### the enclosure
Part of composting is this idea of adding nutrients and things to the sum. As well as tilling it by hand in order to keep things moving and alive within. Thus, the interaction should afford **mixing/rotating**

## the protocol
The metadata will act as living material that will inform the evolution of the related data. Metadata should be mutable and show traces of change. As you till:
- values drift
- tags bleed into neighboring items
- fields get averaged, partially erased, or re-weighted
- some items “surface” and others get buried

# participatory rituals
> Fugitive technologies should necessitate intimacy and relationality between us, our archival materials, and our lineage, history, and community members to strengthen a deeper, more embodied, and confident way of knowing of our memories.

- requiring dialogue with each other abt the data
- collective stewardship
- both needed to change things like weights and metadata

# questions for prototype demo
Each one of these pose a "way of being with data"
- which do you think is stronger? why?
- what interactions do you think would contribute to the goals i mentioned?
- thinking abt voice, text changing or merging w each other
- what kind of data in your lives do you think would be interesting to interact with in these ways?
	- particularly because this is problematizing ways that we archive using traditional tools
	- thinking abt photos app, google maps commons locations and how long you spend there, google searches

# demo feedback
- would be interesting to see how data interact with one another when they bump into each other in space
- make it feel private with whispering as an interaction
	- a confessional!
	- data breach relationship with intimacy
- hand written notations, things in the margins
	- the materiality of handwriting itself
	- notes feel akin to like old youtube commends, how people leave traces on the internet (collective internet memory)
- reverse dating app where instead of curating data driven meetings between people, meet people through the data (personal engagement)
	- that engagement with hands being very key and akin to early ways that people connect and build intimacy (patty cake, etc)
