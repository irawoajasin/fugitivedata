Experimenting with forms of data fugitivity aims to find ways to find refuge in creative and counter sites of data. Placing a feminist and black technoscience into practice, I am curious to tease out interactions and experiences that create alternative ways of being with our data.

For me to experiment with critical fabulation through data archives, I must first obtain a data archive! In all of this work connecting critical archival studies and critical data studies, I have found the definitions of such (a database versus an archive) to be a bit difficult to delineate for me. However, I move forth with a clearer definition:

> A data archive is a collection of computationally or algorithmically collected information about a subject used for analysis, synthesis, prediction, or recall. It is meant to serve as a tool for processing information, organized and described it according to a certain set of standards. It is discoverable and upkept for active use.

With this guiding definition, particularly on the centering of the "subject" I want to work with personal data that is algorithmically or automatically gathered about a human subject to then trouble, warp, and investigate. Options for this may be:

1. social media archives
    - Instagram
        - Posts, photos, videos
        - Check-ins and Places
        - likes
        - search history
2. iCloud
    - Device info, logs
    notes app
3. Google data (takeout.google.com) like
    - emails
    - Photos
    - Maps history and “Your Places”
    - search history
    - Search & activity logs
4. Apple Health
    - Health metrics (heart rate, sleep, workouts) exportable via Health app (export file .xml) or via Apple data request.

To poetically visualize and manipulate this data to produce portraits of our personal data, I must use inspiration tools like:
1. [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) - charts, maps and interactive content
2. [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/) - text analysis
3. [Word Art](https://wordart.com/) - word clouds
4. analog options?

When I think about the technologies that I use for my memory keeping and personal archiving, I use my voice notes and Google Keep more than traditional social media websites. This gets at the point I'm making though in that the raw data of these memories are owned by Google and they are ephemeral in nature in that they can be gone in a moment. They are also inherently vulnerable so exporting them (rescue, fugitivity, escape) and placing them at home in a site of intimacy feels like a poetic exercise in care for fugitive data and intentional engagement with our digital memories. For my demo day iteration, I aim to use my Google Keep data as the primary data material to work with. With this data, I aim to create a platform to upload the data, visualize it using four different metaphors of ways of being with our data, and then trying to put it all on a self-hosted server.

This way, after the initial demo day, I can expant the types of data that the system can handle, think about security and resilience of the software, and then work on physical fabrication.

# the four metaphors

### data composting
Culturally embedded dialog physically around archives supports the sustainability of digital archives by allowing its language and metadata to live, grow, die, and morph based on who the language is in service of at that time.

- fluidity of data in service of our needs
- selective instead of hoarding
- usability > rigidity

### holding hands through the data
Fugitive technologies should necessitate intimacy and relationality between us, our archival materials, and our lineage, history, and community members to strengthen a deeper, more embodied, and confident way of knowing of our memories.

- requiring dialogue with each other abt the data
- collective stewardship
- both needed to change things like weights and metadata

### data confessional
Community control over data, the physical container that houses it, and data infrastructure’s constituents is vital. Protect this by building multiple layers of authentication and social encryption.

- Whisper to append
- you must be authorized to access data
- poetic authentification schema

### memory through embodied storage
Part of knowing is about retention. We must build infrastructure and engage in practices that promote retention of our memories/knowledge on our terms. Slowness and intentional encounters builds intimacy with our documents and strengthens a deeper, more embodied, and confident way of knowing. We hold information in our bodies and we use containers and vessels external to ourselves to transport and pass it on to others.

- embodied experience requiring a repetitive slow motion
- focus on one or a few pieces of data and seep it into your psyche

# the design
Outside of some conceptual decisions being made this week, I also started sketching out some lofi screens to validate and build!

# up next
I aim to build out some interactive lo-fi web pages for each of these four using my google keep data by next week so that I can get focused feedback from class as well as booking office hours with Danya, Craig, and Tega
